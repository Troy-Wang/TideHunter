# TideHunter
==========

Dejavu originally is an open-source project written in python. [Reference here](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu)

TideHunter first transports Dejavu completely to Matlab platform. Then more audio recognition and processiong algorithm (such as MFCC, DTW) will be added to make TideHunter a powerful Matlab audio toolbox.

In the future, TideHunter will also be transported to C/C++ for usage on chips.
